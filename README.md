# GIS-DigitalTwin-UVic

## Description
This project examines how ongoing and future construction at the University of Victoria impacts campus walkability and mobility. Using geospatial analysis, survey data, and an interactive digital twin, we assess pedestrian flow disruptions, safety concerns, and walkway conditions. Our findings highlight frequent construction-related obstacles that hinder accessibility. By integrating community-reported data with spatial modeling, we provide a tool for visualizing mobility scenarios, identifying problem areas, and supporting campus planning efforts to enhance sustainable transportation.

We aim to answer the question of - how does construction affect pedestrian movement? And furthermore, can we provide a tool to help visualize and plan for impacted routes?
